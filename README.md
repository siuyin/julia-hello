# Experiments with the Julia programming language

## shape.jl
Demonstrates use of modules.

Run:

```
julia shape.jl
```

Within the REPL (Read,Evaluate,Print Loop):

`include` the main file. This will also execute the code.

`include("shape.jl")` to access `Shape.*` eg. `Shape.Rectangle`.

```
include("shape-main.jl")
```
